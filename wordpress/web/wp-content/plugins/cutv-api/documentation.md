## Channels

**Channels** are the items that appear on header of the front page.
The sources attached to these channels feed the channels with the videos they import from video services, through the `WPVR Video Robot` plugin.

Channels can be:

- Enabled: Show or hide the channel in the front page.
- Featured: Feature videos in the header of the front page.

Actions:

- Add a channel
- Manage channel
  - Sources for channel
  - Videos in channel
    - Search videos
    - Batch publishing status changes
  - Display options _(thumbnail, name)_

## Sources

**Sources** are used by the `WPVR Video Robot` plugin. They define the service video sources to fetch from. Please refer to the plugin's documentation to know more.

Although sources can be run from the _Sources tab_ in the WP Dashboard, it's highly recommended to do this from the channel's **Videos** tab as the videos get imported automatically.

Trashing videos from the channel's **Videos** tab will mark the videos as _unwanted_.

They can then be restored from the Unwanted Videos page in the `WPVR Video Robot` plugin.
